# v.04
The code was updated to create files with random data of students, containing their first and last names, homework and exam marks. The goal of this version is to print the generated data into two files based on the final mark of each student individually. In the code the user should be able to choose whether they want the final mark to be calculated using median or average. For simplicity of the code and to save time compiling, the mentioned part is commented (feel free to uncomment if you want to).

## Changes compairing to v.01 version
- Generating random files of 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000 and 10000000 students.
- Printing data of students into *aukštesniojoLygio.txt* (if the final mark is >= 5) and *žemesniojoLygio.txt* (if the final mark is < 5).
- Analyzing compile time of file generation, reading, student grouping and printing to according new files.
